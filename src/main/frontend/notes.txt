-   a. Order sequence from the production control to the workstations.
-   b. Status updates from the workstations to the production control.
-   c. Technical drawings (e.g., PDF, JPEG, TIFF) from the production control to the workstations.
-   d. Sensor data from IoT devices to the production control.
-   f. confirmation

2. How often is the production control changing sequences per day?

Normally every shift (3 times / day) or on-demand. On-demand means for quality issues (defect parts, …) or employee sickness etc. a new schedule is necessary. You can do assumptions here.

3- 3. Which data should be in real time? which type of data is meant here? is it the 1.a, 1.b & 1.c or all the above or something else?

Real time data: Order Confirmations that you are able to have a “Google Maps” for the shopfloor. You can see where the order is currently.

4. What contributes the most to the huge date (mehrere Gigabyte) is it the technical drawings?

Traceability data: What happened last days? and also technical drawings.

Production control service: orders service
Status service
Resources service: drawings
Notification service
