# Worker Guidance Web Application
## Overview
The Worker Guidance web application is a cloud-based solution designed to enhance productivity and efficiency in an assembly area with 30 workstations. The main feature of the system is to display the order sequence, which is determined by the production control, in real-time. With a focus on real-time data updates, the application aims to streamline the workflow and optimize the production process. The system also incorporates modules for error logging and material request, which are already available at the workstations.

## Key Features
Real-time Order Sequence Display: The application provides a real-time display of the order sequence determined by the production control. This allows workers to stay updated on the current order and prioritize their tasks accordingly.

Cloud Environment: The application is developed and hosted in a cloud environment, ensuring high scalability, reliability, and accessibility from anywhere with an internet connection.

Gigabyte-scale Data Processing: The system is designed to handle large volumes of data, with an estimated daily volume of several gigabytes. This ensures efficient data processing and storage without compromising performance.

Error Logging Module: The application includes an error logging module that allows workers to log any errors or issues they encounter during the assembly process. This feature helps in identifying and resolving production issues promptly.

Material Request Module: The application incorporates a material request module, enabling workers to request additional materials or supplies directly through the system. This streamlines the procurement process and ensures timely availability of required resources.
